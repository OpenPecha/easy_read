EASY READ
Easy Read is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of reading Tibetan texts. By inserting spaces to separate words, it addresses the common challenge of identifying word boundaries, which often complicates text comprehension for many readers.

The wireframe of the web app looks like this.

The left text area is designated for users to input the text they intend to read. Upon clicking the 'tokenize' button, spaces will be introduced into the text to mark word boundaries, and this modified text will then be displayed in the right text area. A download button is available to save the processed text from the right text area as a .txt file, allowing users to keep it for future reference or share it with others.
